Differences Between var & let keyword
-------------------------------------
1) "variable hoisting" issue raised because 
    of var keyword.

        - as a developer, if we try to access the 
          variable before it's initilization, javascript
          result is "undefined" insted of "error".

        - assigning "undefined" insted of "error" called 
          as variable hoisting.

    we will overcome "variable hoisting" issue by using 
    "let" keyword

2) "var" keyword breaks the scope rule
   "let" keyword obeys the scope rule


3) global polluting issue raised because of "var" 
   keyword 

        - if block code effecting global members called
          as global polluting issue.

    we can overcome global polluting issue by using "let"
    keyword.

4) "var" keyword allows the duplicate members.

    "let" keyword won't allows the duplicate members.
